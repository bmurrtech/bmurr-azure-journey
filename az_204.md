# Azure Services to Automate Your Business Processes

Azure includes four different technologies that you can use to build and implement workflows that integrate multiple systems. *Logic Apps, Microsoft Power Automate, WebJobs and Azure Functions.*

![four_workflows](https://photos.app.goo.gl/uZbB5Vthfena2cux6)

- An __input__ is a piece of data or a file that is supplied to the workflow. 
- A __condition__ is a test often run against an input that may decide which action to execute next.
- An __output__ is a piece of data or a file that is created by the workflow.

#### Logic Apps 
- __Logic Apps__ is a service within Azure that you can use to automate, orchestrate, and integrate disparate components of a distributed application.
    -  You can create or edit a workflow in JSON notation by using the code view.
     - Additionally, there is a GUI designer tool which devs can draw out a business workflow. It is intuitive and easy to use, but devs also have the opportunity to delve under the hood and edit the source code of the workflow. 
    - If you have an unusual or unique system that you want to call from a Logic Apps, you can create your own connector if your system exposes a rest API.

![JSON](https://photos.app.goo.gl/uKgmuoCvozUXfRU68)

   
- A __connector__ is a Logic Apps component that provides an interface to an external service. For example, the Twitter connector allows you to send and retrieve tweets.

#### Power Automate
- Microsoft __Power Automate__  is a service that you can use to create workflows, even when you have no development or IT pro experience.
- Microsoft Power Automate extra help and templates are provided for common types of workflow. _There is no way to edit the source code that the tool creates_. This tool is designed for users who have a good understanding of the business process, but no coding skills.
- There are four different types of flow that you can create.

![four_pa_flows](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ucUxa1PjewM8u1j48)

- __Automated__, a flow that is started by a trigger from some event. For example, the event could be the arrival of a new tweet or a new file being uploaded.
- __Button__. Use a button flow to run a repetitive task with a single click from your mobile device.
- __Scheduled__, a flow that executes on a regular basis, such as once a week, on a specific date, or after 10 hours.
- __Business process__, a flow that models or business process such as the stock ordering process or the complaints procedure.
- Under the hood, Microsoft Power Automate __is__ built on Logic Apps. This means that Power Automate supports the same range of connectors and actions.
- Microsoft Power Automate is intended for office workers and business analysts, while Logic Apps is intended for developers and IT pros. See image below for comparisions:

![comparing_pa_la](https://photos.app.goo.gl/p9TTtWTYx8zw5UsY9)

#### Azure App Services
- The Azure app service is a cloud based hosting service for web applications, mobile back ends and Restful API.
    - For example, in your bike rental system, when a user uploads a photo of a bike, you may need to generate a smaller thumbnail photograph.

##### Web Jobs
- __Web jobs__ are a part of the Azure app service that you can use to __run a program or script automatically__.
- There are two kinds of web jobs:
    - The __continuous web jobs__ run in a continuous loop. For example, you could use a continuous Web job to check shared folder for a new photo.
    -  The __triggered web jobs__ run when you *manually* start them or on a schedule to determine what actions your web jobs takes.
- Web jobs execute scripts.
    - You can script the Web job by writing code in a shell script, such as batch, PowerShell or bash. Alternatively, you can write a program in PHP python node dot Js or javascript.
- Web Jobs Limitations: Only supports ASP.NET / SD 2.x a SP.net SDK to point X.
- __Web Job Cost__: Web Jobs, __you pay for the entire VM or App Service Plan__ that hosts the job. 

##### Azure Function
- __Azure Function Cost__: With the _consumption plan option_, __you only pay for the time when the code runs__.
- Azure Functions is an alternative to Web Jobs, but considered the default choice for most cases. Azure functions can Integrate with many different services, both within azure and from 3rd parties.
    - You should use the __HTTP trigger__ template when you want the code to execute in response to a request sent through the HTTP protocol.
    - Use the __timer trigger__ template when you want the code to execute according to a schedule.
    - Use the __blob trigger__ template when you want the code to execute when a new blob is added to an Azure storage account.
    - Use the __CosmosDB trigger__ template when you want the code to execute in response to new or updated documents in a NoSQL database.

![azfunc_triggers](https://photos.app.goo.gl/korAtDuScUDZqoi96)

> _Practice Quiz_: If you use Azure Functions, you only pay for what you use whereas with 
> Web Jobs, you pay for the entire VM or App Service Plan.
> _Answer_: __False__

- You may choose web jobs for the following reasons:
    - you want the code to be a part of an existing app service application and to be managed as part of that application.
    - Web job supports C# if you are using the Webjobs SDK on the other hand, __Azure Function__ supports C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, and many more.
    - Webjobs can be part of an _app service application_, but Azure functions can't.
    - Webjobs provides _close control of job host_, whereas Azure functions does not.

# Serverless Logic
#### Decide if Serverless Computing Meets Business Needs
- Serverless compute can be thought of as a function as a service, or FaaS or a micro service that is hosted on a cloud platform.
- Your business logic runs as functions and _you don't have to manually provision or scale infrastructure_. The __cloud provider manages infrastructure__. Your _app is automatically scaled out or down depending on load_. 

##### Azure Functions
- Azure Functions is a __serverless__ application platform. It allows developers to host business logic that can be executed without provisioning infrastructure.
- Functions provides intrinsic scalability and you are charged only for the resources used.
- You can write your function code in the language of your choice, including C#, F#, JavaScript, Python, and PowerShell Core. Support for package managers like NuGet and NPM is also included. So _you can use popular libraries_ in your business logic.

![serverless_compute_benefits](https://photos.app.goo.gl/8NY8QWpaAen7hEmn8)

- Limitations of Azure Functions serverless computing is as follows:
    - Timeout of 5 min, up to 10 min. If fucntion requires > 10 mins, must host on a VM.
    - HTTP Request 2.5 min limit.
    - Execution freqency:
        1. Only one fucntion app can be created every 10 sec.
        1. No set limit on single instance traffic.
        1. Different types of triggers have different scaling requirements.

#### Bindings
| Service | Trigger Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Blob Storage | Starts a function when a new or updated blob is detected. |
| Azure Cosmos DB | Start a function when inserts and updates are detected. |
| Event Grid | Starts a function when an event is received from Event Grid. |
| Microsoft Graph Events | Starts a function in response to an incoming webhook from the Microsoft Graph. Each instance of this trigger can react to one Microsoft Graph resource type. |
| Queue Storage | Starts a function when a new item is received on a queue. The queue message is provided as input to the function. |
| Service Bus | Starts a function in response to messages from a Service Bus queue. |
| Timer | Starts a function on a schedule. |

#### Define a Sample Binding


This scenario can be implemented using an Azure Queue Storage trigger and an Azure Table storage output binding.

The following snippet is the function.json file for this scenario.
```JSON
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "order",
      "type": "queueTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "queueName": "myqueue-items",
      "connection": "MY_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING"
    },
    {
      "name": "$return",
      "type": "table",
      "direction": "out",
      "tableName": "outTable",
      "connection": "MY_TABLE_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING"
    }
  ]
}
```

JSON configuration specifies that our function will be triggered when a message is added to a queue named myqueue-items. The return value of our function is then written to the outTable table in Azure Table storage. For PowerShell functions, output bindings are explicitly written to with the Push-OutputBinding cmdlet.

This example is a simple illustration about how we configure bindings for a function. We could change the output to be an email using a SendGrid binding, or put an event onto a Service Bus to notify some other component in our architecture, or even have multiple output bindings to push data to various services.
